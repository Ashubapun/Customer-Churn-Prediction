Customer Churn Prediction:

Customer churn prediction is a data analysis task that involves predicting which customers are likely to stop using a product or service. In this project, several libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, and keras were utilized to analyze and model the data.

The pandas library was used for data manipulation and preprocessing, allowing for efficient handling of the datasets obtained from Kaggle. Numpy provided essential numerical operations and array manipulation capabilities.

Seaborn, a powerful data visualization library, was used to gain insights and understand patterns in the data through various plots and charts. This facilitated a better understanding of the variables and their relationships.

Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library, was employed for various tasks such as feature selection, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. It provided a wide range of algorithms and evaluation metrics for churn prediction.

To build the predictive models, the keras library, which is a high-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow, was employed. Keras provided an easy-to-use interface for constructing models with different layers, including dense layers, dropout layers, and activation functions.

Two different datasets obtained from Kaggle were used to build different churn prediction models. These datasets likely contained information about customers' demographics, past behaviors, usage patterns, and possibly other relevant features. By training and evaluating multiple models on these datasets, it was possible to compare their performance and choose the most effective one.

Overall, this project encompassed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model building using keras, and evaluation of churn prediction models on two distinct datasets from Kaggle. The aim was to identify potential churners and take appropriate actions to retain customers and improve business performance.
